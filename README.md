# Healthcare Infection Analysis Project  

Working with a nationwide healthcare dataset of 222,000+ records, I analyzed hospital-acquired infection (HAI) patterns across U.S. medical facilities. Using Python, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, I transformed raw healthcare data into visual insights about infection rates.
My analysis revealed that actual CAUTI and CLABSI infection rates were approximately 50% lower than predicted national benchmarks. I examined relationships between patient care days and infection ratios, helping to contextualize infection control effectiveness in different hospital settings.
This project strengthened my skills in healthcare data analysis, statistical methods, and data visualization while contributing to the understanding of infection control in hospital environments.
