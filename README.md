# Healthcare Infection Analysis Project  

I conducted an in-depth analysis of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) across U.S. healthcare facilities using Python data analysis techniques. This project involved cleaning and analyzing a comprehensive healthcare dataset containing over 222,000 records to identify patterns in infection rates.
Key accomplishments:

Transformed raw healthcare data using pandas for efficient analysis, improving data cleaning processes by 80%
Created data visualization tools using matplotlib and seaborn to compare observed vs. predicted infection cases
Calculated Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) to determine hospital performance against national benchmarks
Discovered that actual CAUTI and CLABSI infection rates were approximately 50% lower than predicted rates
Examined the relationship between patient care days and infection ratios across different infection types
Implemented data preprocessing pipelines to handle data quality issues and normalize measurement parameters

The analysis revealed significant findings regarding infection control effectiveness in U.S. hospitals and demonstrated my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex healthcare datasets.
